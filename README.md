# Python DFS and BFS Algorithms
This is a simple implementation of the Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms written in Python.

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Python
* Knowledge of DFS and BFS algorithms

## DFS Algorithm

The DFS algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of the vertices to be visited.

## BFS Algorithm

The BFS algorithm visits all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level. The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the vertices to be visited.

## Getting Started

The code can be run using a Python environment such as IDLE or Jupyter Notebook. The code is implemented as a class with two methods: dfs and bfs.

## Input
The input to the algorithm is a graph represented as a dictionary where the keys are the vertices and the values are the list of neighbors.

## Output
The output of the algorithm is the list of vertices visited.

## Conclusion

This implementation of DFS and BFS algorithms in Python serves as a starting point for further development and understanding of these algorithms. The code can be easily modified for different graph representations or for more specific use cases.
